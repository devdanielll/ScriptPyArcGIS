This script is used to access survey layers of ArcGIS Survey123. Its function is to search for layers within the specified survey and check if there are attachments in them. It is possible to obtain and save all attachments of all types. The code does not replace existing attachments; it only adds new attachments. Additionally, it creates a folder with the ObjectID, a name of the person who filled out the survey, and this is also used to match another automation in Power Automate for downloading reports and filling tables in Excel via our GeoTechnology department's internal OneDrive.
